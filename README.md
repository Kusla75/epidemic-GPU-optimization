# Epidemic simulation on a CPU and a GPU

In this paper, an epidemic simulation model using an agent based method, based on the SIR model is examined. The way in which the algorithm of such simulation can be modified is analyzed, so that in addition to execution on the processor, the simulation can also be executed on the graphics card. The simulation model had 15 parameters that could be changed and it was tested to see what types of epidemics it could simulate. The speed of performing such a simulation on the processor and graphics card was also examined. In addition, it was concluded that simulations (performed exclusively on a graphics card) that used atomic functions proved to be extremely better than those simulations that did not use those functions. Simulations with a small number of agents were executed a little faster on the processor, and simulations with an extremely large number of agents were executed much faster on the graphics card. Also, the results of the simulations were compared, so that we can see the difference between the predictions obtained from the simulations that were performed on two different computer components. Increasing the agents in the simulation reduces the difference in the prediction of the simulations.
